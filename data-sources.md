- https://aclanthology.org/volumes/W19-26/ (andrew mccallum has been working on this for awhile, worked with meta for a bit on this, more focused on knowledge graph extraction rather than discourse graph extraction, though)
- https://sci-k.github.io/2021/ (acl workshop - i’ve seen similar things in the past too)
- https://nips.cc/Conferences/2021/ScheduleMultitrack?event=21849 (workshop at neurips last year)

- CIVIC (https://civicdb.org/home) has a good number of high quality evidence statements, though it’s laser focused on cancer genetics.
- discourse graphs from Joel and Matt (and others)
